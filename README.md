First the classes : Under app>java>com.example.paycoprototype:
- Description activity is the class that controls the activity description under layout
-FinalProfile activity is the class that controls the activity_final_profile under layout..The Final_Profile activity ended up being merged

-Fragment_document is the class tat controls the activity doucments under layout.
-Home fragment is the class that controls fragmentHome under layout.
